## Summary

- Hiding the complexity and only showing the essential features of the object 
- Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces
- This means user knows what he is doing but now how the work is being done
- A good way to create abstraction is to use objects

Benefits
- Easier coding by creating shorter programs, increasing productivity
- Composability- once you have defined abstractions you can compose two more abstractions to form a new larger abstraction
